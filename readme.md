This project examines reviews posted on Yelp concerning conventional and alternative medicine.  

From the abstract:

Despite the success of modern, conventional medicine in treating disease, alternative medical establishments continue to flourish. Do patients/patrons of these two kinds of medicine view their treatment experiences differently? If so, what factors influence these differing views? Customer reviews of medical establishments in Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States showed that patients/patrons rate alternative medical establishments more highly than conventional medical establishments. In the reviews, the numbers of words, characters, syllables, punctuation marks, and pronouns; polarity; diversity; lexical classification; and formality did not distinguish between conventional and alternative medicine. But the usage rates of the words “massage” and “chiropractor” did accurately classify reviews with ~90% accuracy. Further analysis of the usage rates of other words may yield insights into why reviewers rate alternative medicine more highly than conventional medicine.
